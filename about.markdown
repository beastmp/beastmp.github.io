My passion for technology ignited at 13 when I received a computer as an 8th-grade graduation gift. My dad would bring home copies of Visual Basic 5 and 6, along with training books, and I dove in headfirst. Watching lines of code come to life as functional software felt like magicâ€”and I was hooked. Since then, my hunger for learning has driven me to pick up new languages and technologies at lightning speed, often mastering them in under a month.

I thrive on tackling complex problems and automating solutions. Thereâ€™s nothing more exciting than streamlining workflows, optimizing processes, and making technology work smarter, not harder. When I get a project that combines problem-solving and automation, Iâ€™m in my element.

Beyond tech, I have another full-time role: being a dad to nine amazing kids. Parenthood has sharpened my ability to lead, manage diverse personalities, resolve conflicts, and juggle high-stakes situationsâ€”all of which translate seamlessly into my work.

At heart, Iâ€™m a geek with a deep admiration for Iron Man. His ability to think on his feet, innovate under pressure, and solve problems with sheer ingenuity has always inspired me to push boundaries as an engineer.

Now, Iâ€™m on the lookout for opportunities where I can put my skills to work, continue expanding my knowledge, and take on exciting new challenges. Letâ€™s build something incredible together!
